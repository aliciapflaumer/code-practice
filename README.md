# Code Interview Practice

This is a place where I'll keep track of coding practice problems. Not all of my practice will be shared on Github – some will be hidden from view.

## Some things to keep in mind:

• Data Structures:

    • Arrays

    • Stacks & Queues

    • Linked lists

    • Hash maps

    • Tree Traversial

• Recursion

• Sorting

• memoization
