# Code Interview Practice

This is a place where I'll keep track of coding practice problems. Not all of my practice will be shared on Github – some will be hidden from view.

## Some things to keep in mind:

• Dynamic programming

  • Arrays

  • memoization

• Recursion

• Sorting

A few Data Structures:

  • Stacks & Queues

  • Linked lists

  • Hash maps

  • Tree Traversial
